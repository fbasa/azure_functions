Azure Functions (C# .NET 8, isolated worker) solution for real-time file & image processing on Blob Storage create/update. It uses Blob Storage (trigger + I/O), Azure AI Vision (Computer Vision) for analysis, and Key Vault for secrets. It’s event-driven, parallelizable, and idempotent, with durable retries and safe concurrency.

# Azure Functions with the trigger, typical Azure services.
## Real-time file & image processing
- Trigger: Blob Storage (create/update)
- Services: Blob Storage, Computer Vision/Media Services, Key Vault
- Why: Event-driven, parallelizable workloads scale per file.
- Watch-outs: Use durable retries + idempotency to avoid double-processing on replays.
## ETL / Data ingestion pipelines
- Trigger: Queue/Service Bus/Event Hub/HTTP
- Services: Data Lake Storage, Synapse, Cosmos DB, SQL, Azure Monitor
- Why: Burstable ingestion with quick transforms and hand-offs.
- Watch-outs: Control concurrency, respect Event Hub partitioning, include poison-message handling.
## IoT telemetry fan-in & enrichment
- Trigger: Event Hub / IoT Hub
- Services: Cosmos DB, Time Series Insights, Digital Twins, Cache (Redis)
- Why: Lightweight per-event enrichment at massive scale with minimal ops.
- Watch-outs: Keep functions stateless; use batching for throughput; watch cold starts on Consumption.
## Scheduled jobs & maintenance tasks
- Trigger: Timer
- Services: Storage, Key Vault, Graph/Management APIs
- Why: Replace VMs/cron for cleanup, backups, syncs, key rotations.
- Watch-outs: Ensure idempotency; add observability + alerts for missed runs.
## Webhook receivers / API glue
- Trigger: HTTP
- Services: API Management, Logic Apps, third-party SaaS
- Why: Perfect for sporadic, lightweight endpoints (Stripe, GitHub, Slack).
- Watch-outs: Use APIM for auth/rate-limits; prefer Premium plan for steady low-latency.
## Event-driven microservices (choreography)
- Trigger: Service Bus/Event Grid
- Services: Service Bus Topics, Event Grid, Cosmos DB, App Config
- Why: Small, single-purpose handlers per domain event; easy horizontal scale.
- Watch-outs: Model idempotency and deduplication; define DLQs and retry policies.
## Orchestrated workflows (Durable Functions)
- Trigger: HTTP/Queue/Timer - Orchestrator
- Services: Durable Functions, Storage, external APIs
- Why: Long-running sagas, fan-out/fan-in, human interaction, compensation.
- Watch-outs: Keep activities small/pure; use external event patterns; mind history size.
## Notifications & messaging fan-out
- Trigger: Queue/Service Bus/Event Grid
- Services: SendGrid/Communication Services, Service Bus Topics, SignalR Service
- Why: Fire-and-forget fan-out to email, SMS, push, or WebSocket clients.
- Watch-outs: Enforce per-channel rate limits; implement DLQs and backoff.
## Stream processing & anomaly detection (near-real-time)
- Trigger: Event Hub (with batches)
- Services: Azure AI/ML endpoints, Redis, Cosmos DB
- Why: Stateless scoring/enrichment on streaming data with elastic scale.
- Watch-outs: Prefer batched triggers; measure end-to-end latency; isolate hot paths.
## Back-office automation / RPA helpers
- Trigger: Timer/HTTP/Queue
- Services: Graph API, SharePoint/OneDrive, Storage, Logic Apps
- Why: Glue scripts without servers—sync files, generate reports, reconcile records.
- Watch-outs: Secure secrets in Key Vault; add circuit-breakers around flaky APIs.
## Quick guidance & best practices
- Plans: Use Premium for always-warm & VNET; Consumption for spiky, cost-sensitive tasks.
- Latency: Minimize cold starts with Premium + pre-warm, .NET isolated worker, and trimmed deps.
- Resilience: Leverage built-in retries, DLQs, and idempotency (dedupe keys, upserts).
- Observability: Emit logs/metrics/traces (App Insights/OpenTelemetry); tag correlation IDs.
- Security: Managed identity + Key Vault; put HTTP endpoints behind API Management.
- Throughput: Tune batch sizes/concurrency per trigger; align with downstream RU/DTUs.
